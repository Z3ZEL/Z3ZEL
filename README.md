# → Interests

> 🎾 I’ve played tennis for 8 years, I stopped after high school because of the lack of time but I’m still often playing it for fun. I’m not really interested by competition. For me sport allows me to empty my head and to be healthy
> 

> 🌿 As I want to work in environment, obviously nature is a big source of inspiration to me. I lived in France countryside when I was younger. I love going outside, getting lost in the wild.
> 

> 🎲 Game development is very important to me, I’m having fun to program from the little game made in 1 month to attend to a game jam and make a game in 48h. It improves my programming skills but also my creativity.
> 

> 👟 Running is also a sport that I love, I’m trying to run once a week. I love this sport because of its facility and because it’s an outside sport.
> 

> 🇵🇱 Summer 2022 : I’ve performed 2/3 of the GR5 in the alpes. I walked 394km for 3 weeks. It has been an intensive experience and the most difficult experience I’ve done so far. I learnt a lot during this journey : working in a team, getting a strong mind, never giving up, overcoming our limits and so much more.
